# ðŸš€ Feed Project - React

This project is part of a Rocketseat course where we're developing a user feed application (similar to a social network). Below are some concepts and best practices used during the development of this application.

# ðŸ“š Learning

I have completed the first part (Fundamentals) of the Rocketseat React course. I learned a lot during this project, especially concepts such as Components, Properties, States, Immutability, best practice patterns in React, and accessibility for users and different devices.

I feel comfortable developing a React application from scratch, with the knowledge acquired in this course. I will continue with another project and also with the course, it is just the beginning!

Let's go!
